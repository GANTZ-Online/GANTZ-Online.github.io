## Description

The classic game of Blackjack aka 21. 
I am very interested in creating the AI  Dealer and being able to write / code the randomization for the game.
I think the challenge will be based on having the dealer to try and get as close to 21 as possible and knowing when it loses for going over 21. 
I also chose this project because there are a lot of resources available that can assist me on this project since I feel like my skills are a bit behind 



## Deployment

The web game is deployed at https://gantz-online.github.io/ (YOUR DEPLOYED GITHUB.IO URL).

Instructions: 
The writing should describe in plain, simple language the logic of the game.
Describe the logic involved in player decisions.
  - What are the choices available to the player?
  - What happens when the player makes a choice?
Describe the logic that evaluates the player's victory/loss/progress status:


Blackjack is a popular card game played in casinos worldwide. Here's a basic description of how to play:

Objective: The main goal of blackjack is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21. If your hand exceeds 21, you "bust" and lose the round.

Card Values: Cards 2 through 10 are worth their face value. Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are each worth 10 points. Aces can be worth either 1 point or 11 points, depending on which value benefits the hand more.

Gameplay: The game begins with each player and the dealer receiving two cards. Players' cards are typically dealt face-up, while the dealer has one card face-up and one card face-down (the "hole" card).

Player's Turn: Players decide whether to "hit" (receive another card) or "stand" (keep their current hand). Other options may include "double down" (double your bet and receive one more card) or "split" (if you have two cards of the same value, split them into two separate hands). The choice depends on the player's total hand value and the dealer's visible card.

Dealer's Turn: After all players have completed their hands, the dealer reveals their face-down card. The dealer must hit until their hand reaches a total of 17 or higher. If the dealer busts, all remaining players win.

Winning: If your hand beats the dealer's without busting, you win even money on your bet. If you and the dealer tie with the same total (a "push"), your bet is returned. Blackjack, an ace and a 10-value card on the initial deal, typically pays 3:2.

- One great idea I hope to be able to add in before the project deadline.
- Another that will be a stretch.
- Something else I don't technically know how to do... *yet*. :)
