## Description

The classic game of Blackjack AKA 21. 

The reasoon why I picked this game for my 1st milestone project is because I wanted to have a better understanding of how to create combinations and utilize randomization with 52 objects. 

I also wanted to learn how to utilize image randomization and apply them to my javascript and be able to call upon them with the in game buttons. 

There were certainly a number of challenges however this assisngment was very eye opening thanks to all of the available resources.

Instructions: 

Blackjack is a popular card game played in casinos worldwide. Here's a basic description of how to play:

Objective: The main goal of blackjack is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21. If your hand exceeds 21, you "bust" and lose the round.

Card Values: Cards 2 through 10 are worth their face value. Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are each worth 10 points. Aces can be worth either 1 point or 11 points, depending on which value benefits the hand more.

Gameplay: The game begins with each player and the dealer receiving two cards. Players' cards are typically dealt face-up, while the dealer has one card face-up and one card face-down (the "hole" card).

Player's Turn: Players decide whether to "hit" (receive another card) or "stay" (keep their current hand). 
The choice depends on the player's total hand value and the dealer's visible card.

Once a player hits the "stay" button, they have commited their hand and will have to refresh the page for a new hand

Dealer's Turn: After all players have completed their hands, the dealer reveals their face-down card. The dealer must hit until their hand reaches a total of 17 or higher. If the dealer busts, all remaining players win.

Winning: If your hand beats the dealer's without busting, you win even money on your bet. If you and the dealer tie with the same total (a "push"), your bet is returned. Blackjack, an ace and a 10-value card on the initial deal, typically pays 3:2.

### Post-MVP Plans

- Id like to add in  immersive effects to game, noises and card flips animations
- Id like to implement a betting / coin earning system 
- overall a smoother and professional look to make it look like you're at a casino table
