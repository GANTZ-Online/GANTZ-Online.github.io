        <h2>How to Play:</h2>
        <p>The goal in Black Jack is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The player and the dealer are dealt two cards. The dealer's second card is hidden.</li>
            <li>Players take turns deciding to "hit" (receive another card) or "stay" (keep their current hand).</li>
            <li>If a player's hand exceeds 21, they bust and lose the round.</li>
            <li>Once all players have finished their turns, the dealer reveals their hidden card.</li>
            <li>The dealer must hit until their hand reaches at least 17.</li>
            <li>The player with a hand value closer to 21 than the dealer wins the round.</li>
            <li>A hand totaling 21 with the first two cards (an Ace and a 10-value card) is called a "blackjack" and wins immediately, unless the dealer also has a blackjack, resulting in a tie.</li>
        </ol>
